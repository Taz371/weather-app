# Work Experience Weather App

## How to run

Open the terminal, use the `cd` command to navigate to the `work-ex-weather-app` folder, and run `npm start`.

## Objectives

1. Have a look at the main `App` component, and see if there's somewhere to put your name in.
2. It looks a tad drab, right? Using the individual component styles, style the app to make it look a little more interesting!
3. The API for the getting the weather returns a lot more data than we currently show. See if you can add more data to the weather app's output.
